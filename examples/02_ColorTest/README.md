This core displays a color gradient square. It is based on the [color test](https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-graphics/) section of Will Green's [Project F](https://projectf.io) blog.

Compared to the basic template, the project separates the display part of the core into its own module. This `display` module is written in SystemVerilog (`.sv`) instead of plain Verilog in order to use its more advanced features like the `logic` type. The display is also full screen on the pocket at 400x360 @ 50hz.

### Code analysis

The `display` module generates the video signals pretty much the same way that the basic template does. Everything takes place inside the `always` block:
```
@(posedge pixel_clock) begin
...
end
```
This is a sequential/synchronous block, which means signals inside this block are only updated when `pixel_clock` goes high. `reset_n` is the Pocket's global reset signal so everything should initialize when this signal goes low. We do this in the first half of the `always` block:
```
if (~reset_n) begin
...
end
```
If `reset_n` is low then we are effectively resetting everything. This signal stays low long enough so that we're guaranteed to not miss it even if the always block is not in the sensitivity list. For more explanation on why we don't put it there, see this [post](https://openfpgatutorials.org/2023/08/28/Resetting-a-core/).

Otherwise, since `pixel_clock` went high, we are just advancing to the next pixel.

It is a good naming convention to use `_n` to indicate a signal that is active when low.

For each pixel clock rising edge, we advance our `x` and `y` coordinates and reset them when they reach the limits. The values are designed so that `x` and `y` are both 0 at the top-left corner of the screen.

You may notice that `video_rgb` seems to be set twice inside the block. This is a common mis-conception when coming from a procedural programming background. In Verilog, each line does **NOT** happen sequentially but rather it all more or less happens at the same time. In this case, the following line:
```
video_rgb <= { 8'd0, 8'd0, 8'd0 };
```
ends up acting as a catch-all state if `video_rgb` is not set by anything else in the block.

If `x` and `y` are less than 256, then `video_rgb` is set to:
```
video_rgb <= { { x[7:4], 4'd0 }, { y[7:4], 4'd0 }, 8'd64 };
```

This uses the `{ }` operator to group bits together into one 24-bit value. `{ x[7:4], 4'd0 }` grabs the top most 4 bits of the `x` position and sets the lowest 4 bits to 0 which produces an 8-bit red value. `y` is used similarly to produce an 8-bit green value and blue is hard-coded to 64.

The reset of the visible pixels are hard coded to an rgb value of [ 0, 16, 48 ].

Finally, remember that assignments in a sequential should always be non-blocking (`<=`).
