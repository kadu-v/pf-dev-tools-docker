This core replicates exactly what the openFPGA [core-template](https://github.com/open-fpga/core-template) does and displays a grey screen.

'core_top.v' is an exact copy of the module found in core-template.

The main purpose here is to provide a baseline to demonstrate the way the build system works and make sure that your environment is correctly setup.
